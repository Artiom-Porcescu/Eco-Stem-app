# Eco-Stem-app

Core idea: The app's main idea is to make other volunteers collaborate with each other in order to clean up the polluted places

Main features:
 - Marking polluted places with a pin and photo attached
 - Reporting inappropriate content
 - Marking the completion of cleaning the polluted place

Desirable features to be added:
 - CoreML addition for trash detection
 - Make chats for volunteers
 - Mark each user's stats, AKA how many polluted places added, how many cleaned etc.
 - New sign up/log in methods
 - Adding more functionality to profile
